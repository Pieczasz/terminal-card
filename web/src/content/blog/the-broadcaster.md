When the game needed a way to tell every player at a table that something had
happened, a library felt like the wrong shape. What the problem actually wanted was a
fan-out with a per-subscriber buffer and an explicit drop policy, which is small enough
to own outright.

## What it actually is

`internal/broadcaster` is about 130 lines and generic over the message type:

```go
type Broadcaster[T any] struct {
	mu             sync.RWMutex
	subscribers    map[int]*subscriber[T]
	nextID         int
	closed         bool
	maxSubscribers int
}
```

`Subscribe()` hands back a `<-chan T` with a 256-slot buffer. `Broadcast(msg)` walks
the map and sends to each one. `Unsubscribe(ch)` finds it, deletes it, closes it. The
lobby uses it for `Event`, the game engine uses it for `game.Event`. Same type, two
instantiations.

That is the whole thing. No topics, no routing keys, no ack.

## What happens when a reader falls behind

The interesting decision is what happens when a subscriber is not draining fast
enough. The obvious options are block or drop, and blocking is out: `Broadcast` runs
while the engine holds its mutexes, so one slow reader would stall the entire table.

So it drops. But the direction matters:

```go
select {
case sub.ch <- msg:
default:
	// Buffer full: drop the oldest and enqueue the newest (latest-wins)
	// so slow subscribers don't get stuck on stale state.
	select {
	case <-sub.ch:
	default:
	}
	select {
	case sub.ch <- msg:
	default:
	}
}
```

Dropping the *newest* message is the easy version and it is wrong here. A card game
view only ever wants the current state of the table. If a client stalls for two
seconds, the thing it needs on waking is the newest snapshot, not the one from two
seconds ago followed by a queue it has to chew through. So the full-buffer path
discards the head and pushes the tail. Latest-wins.

It is the same trade a shallow receive buffer makes: fresh data over complete data.

## Subscribe returns an error, and that was a bug fix

The first version returned a closed channel when the broadcaster was full or shut
down. That reads fine until you look at it from the caller's side:

```go
ch := b.Subscribe()
for ev := range ch { ... }   // exits immediately. why?
```

A closed channel and a finished game are indistinguishable from inside a `range`. A
view handed one would sit there having silently received nothing, with no way to say
whether the game ended or it never got attached. So now:

```go
var (
	ErrClosed     = errors.New("broadcaster is closed")
	ErrAtCapacity = errors.New("broadcaster is at subscriber capacity")
)
```

The caller has to look. The lobby view puts the error on screen, which is how you find
out that the capacity is too low instead of wondering why the roster stopped updating.

## Capacity is `len(players) + 8`

Engines size their broadcaster at the player count plus eight. The eight is for
non-player subscribers - the lobby's watcher goroutine that waits for the game to end
so it can write the ranked result - plus a little room for a reconnect that overlaps
the old session's teardown.

Get that number wrong and a real player is the one who gets refused, which is the worst
possible thing to run out of.

## What it does not do

One process, one node. There is no cross-machine story here at all: subscribers are
map entries in memory, and if you wanted two servers you would replace this with real
pub/sub and nothing else about it would survive. The package comment says so out loud
rather than pretending it is more than it is.

For a game where a session is a few minutes and everyone at a table is attached to the
same process anyway, that is a fine place to stop.
